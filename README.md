# Hurricane Rapid Intensification Analysis
By the end of 2020, the global mean temperature reached 1.2 °C above the pre-industrial baseline. With international climate efforts continuing to miss key benchmarks, there remains little hope of limiting global mean temperature rise below 2 °C. 

One consequence already visible is excess heat absorption in the hydrosphere, increasing the risk of Caribbean hurricanes, which draw their strength directly from the warm Atlantic water. Recent scientific literature has placed renewed focus on a hurricane characteristic called *rapid intensification*. According to the National Hurricane Center, a hurricane undergoes rapid intensification when the maximum wind speed increases by 30 knots (or 35 m.p.h.) in 24 hours. With reduced lead times for safety measures, rapidly intensifying hurricanes present an exceptional risk to life and property. This report uses exploratory data science and machine learning methods to investigate and predict rapidly intensifying storms forming in the Atlantic Ocean.
